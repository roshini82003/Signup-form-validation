# Signup-form-validation
PROJECT DESCRIPTION

This project is a Simple Sign-Up Form built with HTML and CSS. It features basic client-side validation for three fields: Name, Email, and Password. The form provides real-time visual feedback to the user, indicating whether the entered data is valid or invalid.

FEATURES:

•	Name Field: A text input where the user must enter their full name.

•	Email Field: A field that checks if the email format is valid (e.g., user@example.com).

•	Password Field: A password input that requires a minimum of 6 characters.

•	Validation Feedback:

o	Valid Inputs: The input fields turn green when valid data is entered.

o	Invalid Inputs: Invalid data causes the fields to turn red.

•	Responsive Design: The form is designed to be centered on the screen and adapts well to different screen sizes.

This project demonstrates the use of HTML5 form attributes like required, type="email", and minlength, as well as CSS for styling and feedback.
